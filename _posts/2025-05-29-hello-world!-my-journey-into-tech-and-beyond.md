Welcome to my blog!

I'm **Abdul**, a Master's student in Information Technology with a strong passion for building things that live on the internet — from mobile apps to web systems, and even IoT devices that talk to the cloud.

Over the past few years, I’ve:

- 🧑‍💻 Contributed building cross-platform apps using **Flutter**
- 🖥️ Explored system administration and **Linux** internals
- ☁️ Dived into **DevOps tools** and best practices
- 🌐 Created full-stack web applications 
- 📡 Learned IoT solutions with **ESP32** and Firebase

This blog will serve as my public notebook — a place where I share what I learn, build, and experiment with. Expect posts about:

- Real-world coding tips
- SQL an No-SQL database insights
- Linux command-line and Windows powershell tutorials
- DevOps and system administration guides
- Project walkthroughs
- Machine learning roadmap (that I am following so far)

Thanks for stopping by. Stay tuned 🚀

You can also check out my GitHub and reach out if you’d like to collaborate!

*Happy coding!*

As I started the programming, to be very honest they were just the programs which was only supposed to run, nothing else. While there are many other crucial checks to consider at the time of coding, which we neglect in most of the cases. It's not just about the piece of code, it is more about programming style, software construction, coding standards, architecture, security, abstraction and SOLID principles etc. 


When I started programming, to be very honest I just wanted to make things run. A green checkmark, no errors — that was success. But as I grew, I realized: **working code is only the beginning.**

Reading *Code Complete* by Steve McConnell made me reflect on how much I was missing.
*Highly recommended by respected @recluze*

## 💡 Code is Not Just Code

Most of us write code that "just works." But McConnell emphasizes on:

- Structure (architecture)
- Reusability (abstraction)
- Clean layout (readability)
- Safety features (security)
- Standards (naming, formatting, consistency)

I used to skip all of these — until I started breaking things I built myself 😅

## 🛠 What I Learned from *Code Complete*

### 🧼 1. Code is Communication First
> "Good code is like good writing — clear, expressive, and maintainable."

It’s not written just for the compiler; it’s written for your future self and teammates.

---

### 🧱 2. Construction Matters

Most bugs don’t appear in planning or testing — they originate during **construction**. McConnell dedicates entire chapters to:

- Writing clear control structures
- Using meaningful names
- Commenting effectively (not excessively)
- Defensive programming practices

---

### 🧩 3. The Power of Abstraction

Too many variables? Nested conditions? Time to **abstract**. Good abstraction keeps complexity manageable and makes systems scalable.

---

### 🔍 4. Quality is a Discipline

Testing is not an afterthought. Write **clean**, **testable** code. Handle errors before they break something.

---

## ⚖️ From "Does it Work?" to "Is it Well Built?"

I’ve now begun applying principles like:

- **KISS** (Keep it Simple, Stupid)
- **YAGNI** (You Aren’t Gonna Need It)
- **SOLID principles**
- **Code reviews**
- Choosing clarity over cleverness

These changes look simple — but they make all the difference.

---

## 📚 Final Thoughts

I have started Reading *Code Complete* which is helping me to shift from:
🚧 **"Does it work?"**  
to  
🏗 **"Is it well built?"**

If you're serious about software — not just hacking things together — this book is worth every page.

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I wanted to share the setup and tools I use daily to stay productive while learning and building something.

---

### Operating System

I primarily use **Linux (Ubuntu)** as my main operating system. Itâ€™s lightweight, powerful, and perfect for:

- Programming (Python, Flutter, Node.js)
- Managing servers and Docker containers
- Learning the OS fundamentals efficiently
- System administration and networking practice

---

### Code Editors & IDEs

- **VS Code**: My go-to code editor for almost everything. It has great extensions for languages, Git, and more.
- **Android Studio**: Mainly for Flutter app development and testing.
- **Terminal**: I love working in the terminal with tools like `netstat`, `vi`, `ssh` and utilities like `grep`.

---

### Version Control

- **Git** and **GitHub** are essential for managing code and collaborating.

---

### Communication & Learning

- **YouTube** â€” channels like Dr Mohammad Naumanâ€™s have been super helpful.
- **Discord & Slack** â€” for developer communities and quick help.
- **Twitter** â€” A powerful tool to follow tech leaders, stay updated on trends, and discover learning resources through threads and discussions.

---

### Other Tools

- **Docker**: For containerizing apps and experimenting with DevOps workflows.
- **Postman**: To test APIs during backend work.
- **AWS EC2**: for Development to Deployment.
- **Cisco Packet Tracer**: For practicing network configs and topologies.

This setup is evolving as I learn more, but these tools have helped me tremendously so far.

When creating my online presence, I wanted a name that wasn’t just an identifier — but a **statement**, a tribute, and a reflection of my journey.

## `marrecluse = MAR + recluze`

The name **"marrecluse"** is a blend of two identities:

- **MAR**: These are the initials of my full name — *Muhammad Abdul Rahman*. This represents me.
- **recluze**: This is taken from the YouTube channel of **Dr. Mohammad Nauman**, known as [recluze](https://www.youtube.com/@recluze). He’s not just a teacher, but a role model in the world of programming, computer science, philosphy and life-long learning.

## Why recluze?

I came across Dr. Nauman's channel while learning the foundations of programming and computer science. His teaching style, deep understanding of Linux, and his way of breaking down complex topics truly shaped my mindset.

</a>

Even though we've never met, **his channel is one of the most important stepping stones** in my learning journey. Including "recluze" in my alias is my way of honoring the knowledge, mentorship, and inspiration he shared with learners like me — for free, and with passion.

> **Best advice that I give to students is: just follow this channel, and you're good to go.** 🎯


## Identity with Purpose

So, when you see `marrecluse` — know that it's not just a handle.

It's a **symbol of gratitude**, **a story of learning**, and a constant reminder of where I came from and who helped me get here.
